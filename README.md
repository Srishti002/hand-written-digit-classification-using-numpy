# Hand-written digit classification using Numpy
## Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognize the human handwritten digits from different sources like images, papers, touch screens, etc, and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9).

So, here we are making *ANN* from scratch using *Numpy* for handwritten digit classification

## Dataset and Data loading :-
The dataset which we are using here is MNIST dataset. MNIST contains a total of 70,000 handwritten digit images (60,000 - training set and 10,000 - test set) in 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased.
